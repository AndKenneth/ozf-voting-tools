i use these tools to track voting on ozfortress

## usage
Execute the tool with the source file as a command line parameter. This source file should essentially be a direct copy paste from the forum thread that this came from, just one after another. Both tools work this way.

## disclaimer
This tool is so freaking specialized that I have no clue why you'd want to use it. It's also not a very good idea to take any ideas from this code, as it's pretty much literal code vomit because I have no shame.
